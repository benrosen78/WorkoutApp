# Workout Routine

I've been on the same workout plan as my brother for a while now. Instead of logging our sets in the notes app or google sheets, I felt like I'd make an app that is specifically catered to our plan. While the app only works with our plan right now, I do plan to make it so that you can customize the workout plan within the app. Once I do this, I will push the app to the app store.

# Functionality

Record your sets for the day. You can choose a weight and # of reps for each set. Easily look back at your numbers from any previous day by going to the calendar. The calendar also has a blue color if you recorded that day, so you can easily see when your off days were.
